    <p1 style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Web programming</b> to the writing, markup and coding involved in Web development, 
        which includes Web content, Web client and server scripting and network security. 
        The most common languages 
        used for Web programming are XML, HTML, JavaScript, 
        Perl 5 and PHP. Web programming is different from just 
        programming, which requires interdisciplinary knowledge 
        on the application area, client and server scripting, and database technology.

    <h1 style="background-color: antiquewhite; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-weight: bold;"><center>Explains Web Programming</center></h1>
    <p1 style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><i>Web programming can be briefly categorized into client and server coding.</i> The client side needs programming related to accessing data from users and providing information. It also needs to ensure there are enough plug ins to enrich user experience in a graphic user interface, including security measures.
    To improve user experience and related functionalities on the client side, JavaScript is usually used. <u>It is an excellent client-side platform for designing and implementing Web applications.
    HTML5 and CSS3 supports most of the client-side functionality provided by other application frameworks.</u>
    <b>The server side needs programming mostly related to data retrieval, security and performance. Some of the tools used here include ASP, Lotus Notes, PHP, Java and MySQL. There are certain tools/platforms that aid in both client- and server-side programming. Some examples of these are Opa and Tersus.</b></p1>
    <p1 style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><li style="background-color: aliceblue;">HTML or HyperText Markup Language is the foundation of web development that every developer needs to be familiar with. A popular skill for web developers,it is the 2nd most commonly used language in 2020, according to a survey by Stack Overflow.</li></p1>

    <h1 style="background-color: antiquewhite; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><center>Front-End vs Back-End Web Development</center></h1>
    <p1 style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Even if you’re new to web development, you’ve probably heard the terms “front-end development” and “back-end development” before. But what do they mean?
    Front-end web development has to do with the interface that you, the user, interact with when you visit a website or use a web application. <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/resources/blog/what-does-a-front-end-developer-do/?utm_source=ccblog&utm_medium=ccblog&utm_campaign=ccblog&utm_content=cw_what_is_web_development_blog"><b>Front-End Developers </b></a>create everything you see on a web page, including:</p1>
    <li style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Layout</b></li>
    <li style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Colors</b></li>
    <li style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>Navigation</b></li>
    <P style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Back-end web development has to do with the parts of a website that you can’t see, particularly how website information is stored and retrieved.
    When you access a webpage in your browser, you’re essentially requesting to see a file stored on a <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/general/server?utm_source=ccblog&utm_medium=ccblog&utm_campaign=ccblog&utm_content=cw_what_is_web_development_blog"><b>server</b></a> somewhere. When you load a webpage for the first time or sign into a website with a username and password, it’s <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/resources/blog/what-does-a-back-end-developer-do/?utm_source=ccblog&utm_medium=ccblog&utm_campaign=ccblog&utm_content=cw_what_is_web_development_blog"><b>Back-End Developers</b></a>who make it possible to access website information efficiently and securely.
    Now that you understand the basics of web development, let’s look at how a website or web application comes to life from two perspectives: the web development process and the web development team.</P>
